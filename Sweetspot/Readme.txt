
The directory "Program" contains Mplus input files for simulations to explore 
the region of meaningful correlations between "0 and 1"

It also contains a sample Mplus file that can be run independently 
(using the regular or trial version of Mplus, see www.statmodel.com).

The directory "Plots" contains the Stata data file with a summary of the simulations, 
and the Stata code to make the plots, as in "Meaningful Mediation Analysis"
