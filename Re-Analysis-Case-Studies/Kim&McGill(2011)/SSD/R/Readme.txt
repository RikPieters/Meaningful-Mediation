The R-file contains all code to estimate Model 1 and Model 2 of Kim and McGill (2011), 
as shown in the Appendix of the Meaningful Mediation paper.
It also estimates Compositie Reliability and Discriminant Validity

To run the models and examine the output:

1. Install the latest version of R
2. Install the latest version of RStudio
3. Start RStudio
4. Open the relevant file in RStudio by "Open File" from the menu and indicating the path and name of the R-file
5. Highlight all the code shown in the top window of RStudio (e.g., by right-clicking in the R_code, and then "select all")
6. Run the file (select "run" button at middle-right-top in RStudio) 
7. Inspect the output. Default is that output is saved on C:\
   Change this by changing the path in the R-file
