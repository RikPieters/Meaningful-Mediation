Do:

1. Place data and input files in the same (sub)directory
2. Start the Mplus program
3. Run "input file" (= name.inp)


There are two data and input files


Data file 1: coffee_ssd_us.data

"us" indicates "unstandardized" data.
Use the input files with "us" in the name 
These data give the same (unstandardized) results as in Kupor and Tormala (2015).



Data file 2: coffee_ssd_ps.dat 

"ps" indicates "partially standardized" data.
Means of Ms and Y are 0, and SDs are 1.
Use the input files with "ps" in the name  

These data give the partially standardized results as in the appendix of the meaningful mediation paper.
