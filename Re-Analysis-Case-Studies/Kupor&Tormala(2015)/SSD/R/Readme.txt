R-code to estimate models 1-3 for Kupor and Tormala (2015) as shown in Appendix
of Meaningful Mediation paper.
The code also estimates the Statistical Power of obtaining the indirect and direct effects.
The latter uses simulations, which may take a bit longer.


To run the models and examine the output:

1. Install the latest version of R
2. Install the latest version of RStudio
3. Start RStudio
4. Open the relevant file in RStudio by "Open File" from the menu and indicating the path and name of the R-file
5. Highlight all the code shown in the top window of RStudio (e.g., by right-clicking in the R_code, and then "select all")
6. Run the file (select "run" button at middle-right-top in RStudio) 
7. Inspect the output. Default is that output is saved on C:\
   Change this by changing the path in the R-file
